## Getting Started ##

1. Install Python 3

2. Initialize a virtual environment (this will keep installed files within the virtual environment, not affecting the global python libraries)

`python -m venv env`

*Note: this may hang for a few seconds*

3. Install the required modules into your virtual environment
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Setup python path 
`source setup_pythonpath.sh`

5. Test the application
[todo] `python test/*`

6. Run the server
`cd src` 
`python app.py`

6. Verify the server is working
in your browser, visit 127.0.0.1:5000.
